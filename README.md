This was a codecademy Project titled Colmar Academy. Lessons learned was used to create this website
titled QSLN Academy. A previous repository was done in the name of Colmar Academy and pushed to Github.
I need to decide if I will keep Colmar Academy for learning purposes but I have decided to push forward
to complete QSLN Academy.


Note that only a design was provided by Codecademy and so it required that the student
use the knowledge gained to build their website. This is incomplete because the full design has not yet
been implemented up to today 06 April 2023.

It is still 06 April 2023 and I decided to add a .pdf file on how to do a pull request to my project folder.
I decided to place .pdf files in my .ignore so that I can see it only in my terminal on my computer but not
push the .pdf to Github. So I should not see this .pdf file at Github but I should be able to read it
on my local computer.

OK, that was a success. I did not see the .pdf at Github. I then forked by own repo then cloned it back to my 
terminal. This new folder on my terminal is where I am modifying this README.md but maybe I should have created 
a branch first..????
