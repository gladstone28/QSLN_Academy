This was a codecademy Project titled Colmar Academy. Lessons learned was used to create thi website
titled QSLN Academy. A previous repository was don in the name of Colmar Academy and pushed to Github.
I need to decide if I will keep Colmar Academy for learning purposes but I have decided to push forward
to comple QSLN Academy


Note that only a design was provided by Codecademy and so it required that the student
use the knowledge gained to build their website. This is incomplete because the full design has not yet
been implemented up to today 06 April 2023.
